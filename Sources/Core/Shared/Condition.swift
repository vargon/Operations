/**
 Condition Operation

 Conditions are a core feature of this framework. Multiple
 instances can be attached to an `Operation` subclass, whereby they
 are evaluated to determine whether or not the target operation is
 executed.

 ConditionOperation is also an Operation subclass, which means that it
 also benefits from all the features of Operation, namely dependencies,
 observers, and yes, conditions. This means that your conditions could
 have conditions. This allows for expressing incredibly rich control logic.

 Additionally, conditions are evaluated asynchronously, and indicate
 failure by passing an ConditionResult enum back.
